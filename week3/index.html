		</div>
                <p>I'm an APC student enrolled in BSCS-SF221.</p>
		<p>I chose this course because I <em>love</em> working with computers (e.g., programming and debugging
things) and I heard that cybersecurity was one of the best fields to get into in this area.</p>
		<p>I also like playing the piano (any songbook I can get my hands on <del>usually Taylor Swift)</del>, reading books (particularly Brandon Sanderson), and playing games (usually roguelikes or survival games like Donâ€™t Starve Together).</p>
